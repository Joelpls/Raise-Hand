Hello, welcome to my domain.

This is the branch for the web version of Raise Hand. This will contain the portal or the admins and include modules for teacher, teaching assistants, and students.

mr-schneider and rssnyder are the same person (Riley Snyder). I just forgot to switch back to my school account for most of the commits during the initial project creation.
